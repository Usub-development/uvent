task::Awaitable<void> session(net::TCPClientSocket sock)
{
    utils::DynamicBuffer buf;
    for (;;)
    {
        buf.clear();
        ssize_t n = co_await sock.async_read(buf, 64 * 1024);
        if (n <= 0)
            break;
        co_await sock.async_write(buf.data(), buf.size());
    }
}

task::Awaitable<void> listen()
{
    net::TCPServerSocket acceptor{"0.0.0.0", 8080};
    for (;;)
        co_await acceptor.async_accept(session); // one coroutine per connection
}
```

## Why uvent

- **Coroutines are the API, not an add-on.** Every I/O operation is a `co_await`; there are no callback overloads, no
  handler types to erase, no manual state machines. Sync primitives, channels, timers and cancellation are all
  coroutine-native.
- **Structured concurrency, Go/Rust style.** `task::spawn` returns a `JoinHandle`, `TaskScope` is a nursery, and
  cancellation is a tree: cancel a parent and every sleep, socket read, channel wait and lock under it wakes up and
  returns. `sync::select` waits on channels, timers, tokens, events and semaphores at once.
- **Only the C++ standard library.** No Boost, no libuv, no third-party headers. One `FetchContent` line and you are in.
- **Native backend on every major OS** – `epoll` (edge-triggered) or `io_uring` on Linux, `kqueue` on macOS/BSD, IOCP on
  Windows – behind a single `TCPServerSocket` / `TCPClientSocket` / `UDPSocket` API.
- **Built for servers that stay up.** uvent runs the backend of a production: HTTP APIs, PostgreSQL,
  Redis and RPC traffic between ~10 services all flow through this runtime (see [Ecosystem](#ecosystem)). When something
  does hang, the opt-in [introspection](#introspection) layer dumps every live coroutine with its wait reason.

## Backends

| OS / family                                    | Backend primitives                                                           | Implementation                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux                                          | `epoll` (edge-triggered), non-blocking sockets / **`io_uring` (optional)**   | `SocketLinux`, `SocketLinuxIOUring`, `EPoller`, `IOUringPoller` |
| macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD | `kqueue`, non-blocking sockets (`accept` + `fcntl`)                          | `SocketBSD`, `KQueuePoller`                                     |
| Windows 10+ / Windows Server 2016+             | **IOCP** (`WSARecv` / `WSASend` / `AcceptEx` / `ConnectEx` / `TransmitFile`) | `SocketWindows`, `IocpPoller`                                   |

The backend is chosen automatically at build time: Linux → `epoll` (or `io_uring` with `-DUVENT_ENABLE_IO_URING=ON`,
kernel 5.1+ and [liburing](https://github.com/axboe/liburing)), Windows → IOCP, BSD/macOS → `kqueue`.

## Highlights

- **C++23 coroutines end to end** – `co_await` on accept/read/write/connect; `Awaitable<T>` with customizable frames.
- **Tasks & structured concurrency** – `task::spawn` → `JoinHandle<T>` (await the result, cancel the subtree, detach);
  `TaskScope` groups tasks so they are cancelled and joined together; plain `co_spawn` stays allocation-free for
  fire-and-forget.
- **Hierarchical cancellation** – `CancellationSource`/`CancellationToken` form a tree; a cancelled task's pending
  `sleep_for`, socket I/O, channel op, mutex or semaphore wait returns immediately with a clear result.
- **`select`** – Go-style `sync::select(ch.recv_op(), tok.on_cancel_op(), sync::sleep_op(5s))` over heterogeneous
  operations; one park, first branch wins, no double resumes.
- **Channels** – bounded MPMC `AsyncChannel<Ts...>` with back-pressure, and `AsyncUnboundedChannel<Ts...>` on a
  lock-free segmented queue for producers on non-runtime threads (logging callbacks, signal handlers).
- **Coroutine-native synchronization** – `AsyncMutex`, `AsyncSemaphore`, `AsyncEvent`, `WaitGroup`, `AsyncBarrier`;
  waiters suspend instead of blocking threads.
- **One acceptor per worker thread** – `async_accept(handler)` drains the whole kernel backlog per wakeup and spawns a
  coroutine per connection; with `SO_REUSEPORT` every worker owns its own listener, no accept lock, no lost edges in ET
  mode.
- **Async DNS + Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305)** – `net::async_resolve` never blocks the loop; `net::connect_happy` races
  IPv6/IPv4 with staggered attempts and instant fallback.
- **Instant cross-thread wakeups** – parked pollers are signalled via `eventfd` / `EVFILT_USER` /
  `PostQueuedCompletionStatus`; a resume never waits for the idle tick.
- **Timer wheel** – millions of cheap one-shot timers, coroutine `sleep_for`, per-socket inactivity timeouts.
- **Cooperative budget** – a hot coroutine is forced through the scheduler after N fast-path completions, so one
  connection can't starve a worker.
- **Introspection (opt-in)** – `introspection::dump()` prints every live coroutine: name, wait reason, wait time, trace
  id, owning worker.
- **Lock-free internals** – QSBR and hazard-pointer reclamation, intrusive MPSC queues, sharded concurrent containers,
  pre-allocated operation pools.

## Quick start

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(uvent
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Usub-Foundation/uvent.git
        GIT_TAG v3.9.0)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(uvent)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE usub::uvent)
```

Minimal HTTP keep-alive server, one acceptor per worker thread:

```cpp
#include "uvent/Uvent.h"

using namespace usub::uvent;

task::Awaitable<void> clientCoro(net::TCPClientSocket socket)
{
    static constexpr size_t max_read_size = 64 * 1024;
    static constexpr std::string_view response =
        "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
        "Content-Type: application/json\r\n"
        "Content-Length: 20\r\n"
        "\r\n"
        "{\"status\":\"success\"}";

    utils::DynamicBuffer buffer;
    buffer.reserve(max_read_size);
    socket.set_timeout_ms(5000); // idle connections are closed by the timer wheel

    while (true)
    {
        buffer.clear();
        ssize_t rdsz = co_await socket.async_read(buffer, max_read_size);
        if (rdsz <= 0)
        {
            socket.shutdown();
            break;
        }
        socket.update_timeout(5000);
        ssize_t wrsz = co_await socket.async_write(
            const_cast<uint8_t*>(reinterpret_cast<const uint8_t*>(response.data())), response.size());
        if (wrsz <= 0)
            break;
    }
}

task::Awaitable<void> listeningCoro()
{
    net::TCPServerSocket acceptor{"0.0.0.0", 45900};
    for (;;)
        co_await acceptor.async_accept(clientCoro);
}

int main()
{
    usub::Uvent runtime(4); // 4 worker threads
    runtime.for_each_thread([&](int threadIndex, thread::ThreadLocalStorage*) {
        system::co_spawn_static(listeningCoro(), threadIndex);
    });
    runtime.run();
}
```

`async_accept` takes a coroutine function directly – every accepted connection is spawned as its own coroutine, no
manual
loop or `co_spawn` needed.

### Structured concurrency, `select` and cancellation

```cpp
sync::AsyncUnboundedChannel<Job> jobs;

task::Awaitable<uint64_t> worker(int id)
{
    system::this_coroutine::set_name("worker");
    uint64_t done = 0;
    for (;;)
    {
        auto r = co_await sync::select(jobs.recv_op(), sync::sleep_op(200ms));
        if (r.cancelled())          // our task (or an ancestor) was cancelled
            break;
        if (r.is<1>())              // 200 ms idle
            continue;
        auto& item = r.get<0>();    // std::optional<std::tuple<Job>>; nullopt = channel closed
        if (!item)
            break;
        done += process(std::get<0>(*item));
    }
    co_return done;
}

task::Awaitable<void> handler()
{
    task::TaskScope scope;                 // nursery, child of the current task
    scope.spawn(worker(0), /*thread*/ 0);
    scope.spawn(worker(1), /*thread*/ 1);
    auto producer = scope.spawn(produce(jobs));

    co_await producer;                     // JoinHandle: wait for one task
    co_await scope.cancel_and_join();      // cancel the rest, wait for all of them
}
```

Cancellation is cooperative and reaches every suspension point: a cancelled `sleep_for` returns `false`, socket ops
return `-1` with `errno == ECANCELED`, channel/select ops report `cancelled()`. Nothing is killed mid-flight.

### Connecting out: Happy Eyeballs

Dual-stack clients shouldn't hang on a broken IPv6 path. `connect_happy` implements RFC 8305: AAAA and A are resolved in
parallel and the addresses are raced – the first successful connect wins, a fast failure starts the next address
immediately:

```cpp
#include "uvent/net/HappyEyeballs.h"

task::Awaitable<void> fetch()
{
    auto res = co_await net::connect_happy("example.org", "443");
    if (!res)
        co_return; // res.error(): last ConnectError

    net::TCPClientSocket sock = std::move(*res);
    // sock.ipv says which family won; use async_write/async_read as usual
}
```

For a plain single-address connect, `TCPClientSocket::async_connect(host, port[, timeout])` resolves asynchronously and
never blocks the loop.

### Introspection

Build with `-DUVENT_TASK_INTROSPECTION=ON` and every live coroutine becomes visible – from a signal handler, an admin
endpoint or a watchdog coroutine:

```cpp
introspection::dump();   // frame, parent, name, wait reason ("socket.read", "channel.recv", "sleep"...), waiting_ns, trace id
auto tasks = introspection::snapshot();
```

`this_coroutine::set_name` / `set_trace_id` tag frames; trace ids are inherited by children. With the option off the
calls compile to no-ops, so call sites need no `#ifdef`.

See [`examples/`](examples) for structured concurrency, channels, `select`, timers, resolver and Happy Eyeballs demos.

## Benchmarks

HTTP/1.1 keep-alive echo (`wrk -c1000`, 30 s per run, 3 s warm-up), server and `wrk` on the same host.
Each server uses one event loop per thread with its own `SO_REUSEPORT` listener; the libuv server spawns one loop per
thread the same way, so all three scale on the same terms.

| Threads | uvent RPS | Boost.Asio RPS | libuv RPS | uvent p99 | Boost.Asio p99 | libuv p99 | runs |
|--------:|----------:|---------------:|----------:|----------:|---------------:|----------:|-----:|
|       1 |   107,647 |        113,537 |   113,503 |   8.94 ms |        6.03 ms |   6.53 ms |    1 |
|       2 |   209,711 |        209,883 |   210,899 |   4.83 ms |        4.41 ms |   4.77 ms |    1 |
|       4 |   381,159 |        384,020 |   386,309 |   3.28 ms |        2.67 ms |   2.75 ms |    1 |
|       8 |   541,207 |        498,647 |   588,272 |   2.01 ms |        2.36 ms |   2.68 ms |    3 |

Host: 1× Intel Xeon E5-2640 v4 (10 cores / 20 threads, 2.4 GHz), Linux 6.8, GCC 13.3, `-O3 -march=native` + LTO;
uvent `f678513` (epoll backend), Boost 1.83, libuv 1.49.2. `wrk -t<threads> -c1000 -d30s --latency`, 3 s warm-up.
Cells with `runs = 3` are the mean of three runs (spread < 4 %), the rest are single runs.

**What to take from this:** up to 4 threads the three libraries are within 2–5 % of each other – on a parse-free echo
the kernel, not the event loop, is the bottleneck. At 8 threads (where `wrk` competes for the same cores) libuv pulls
~9 % ahead of uvent and uvent ~8 % ahead of Boost.Asio, with uvent showing the lowest p99. In other words: you pay
nothing for coroutines. What uvent buys you is the API – `co_await` instead of callback chains – and zero dependencies,
at the throughput of the C-level loops.

Sources, scripts and raw `wrk`
output: [Usub-Foundation/io_perfomance](https://github.com/Usub-Foundation/io_perfomance).
Numbers depend heavily on the host; run `scripts/run_all.sh` there to get yours.
